# For-Loop Elements
The for-loop consists of three main elements:
* Initialization: sets the starting value of the loop variable
* Condition: determines whether the loop should continue or terminate
* Modification: updates the loop variable after each iteration

::right::

# Example Use Case
For example, in a loop that iterates over an array of numbers:
```
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i]);
}
```
* Initialization: let i = 0
* Condition: i < numbers.length
* Modification: i++
